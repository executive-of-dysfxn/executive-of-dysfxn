Make sure to buckle up while I figure out what this site will be.

### Welcome to the garden, let’s hope it thrives.
*March 15, 2022*

Listen, this whole website, digital garden, not-quite-blog journal, *thing* has been years in the making. I’ve started and forgotten blogs and gardens more times than I can keep track of with the 🌈 magic of ADHD! 🙌

I’ll spare the reader my history of being a personal website creator and enjoyer (omg it’s been more than 20 years!?) and I'll just say 2020/2021 has included several attempts to move toward a digital garden style site using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and GitHub. Several of these have worked beautifully! The problem is I usually get sucked into the more insignificant details and then forget to come back to the project.

I’m starting to get it though: I can try out templates and methods **outside** of my Obsidian vault and see if I like what I’m looking at. I can even do this before (⁉️) I 100% commit to changing my entire Obsidian vault configuration, creating arbitrary workflow for myself, and then realize it’s not sustainable. What a world right? I can <ins>try</ins> something while I’m balls deep in hyperfocus mode in more of a sandbox space. And when I forget said thing exist two weeks later, it won’t have complicated my already messy vault space. 

Well dang. Let’s do that.
